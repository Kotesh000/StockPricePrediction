# Stock Price Prediction

This project involves predicting stock prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The model helps forecast stock price trends, which can assist investors and analysts in making informed decisions.

## Format:
The dataset contains information about stocks, including variables like TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales. The goal is to predict the stock price based on these features.

## Repository Contents
- **Code**: Contains the source code files for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data**: The dataset used for stock price prediction is included in the repository (or instructions on how to download it).

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features).
- **Modeling**: Multiple models are used for prediction, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and XGB Classifier.
- **Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix plots are used for further performance analysis.
- **Visualization**: Data visualization techniques are used to explore relationships between features and stock prices.
- **Feature Engineering**: New features like 'open-close,' 'low-high,' and 'is_quarter_end' are created for better prediction accuracy.

## Usage
To use the stock price prediction system:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install necessary libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided Python script to load the dataset and preprocess the data.
4. Train the machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
5. Visualize results using the provided plotting functions.
